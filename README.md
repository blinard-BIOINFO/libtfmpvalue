# libtfmpvalue

A cmake overlay for TFMpvalue C++ library

This repo serves as a wrapper for the incredibly useful [TFM-Pvalue C++ program](http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/tfm-pvalue/tfm-pvalue.php). It allows users to determine score thresholds for a given transcription factor position frequency matrix associated with a specific p-value. Naturally, it can also perform the reverse, quickly calculating an accurate p-value from a score for a given motif matrix.

``libtfmpvalue`` allows this functionality to be easily exploited in any cmake-based source builds.
It does several things, that can be turned on/off via cmake options : 
  - core sources are built as a (static) library  (minimum target)
  - package command-lines can be compiled via dedicated targets (optionnal)
  - tests from the original packages are implemented as cmake tests (optionnal)
  - some compilation flags can be turned on/off for debugging

Original sources can be found at http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/tfm-pvalue/tfm-pvalue.php.

Cmake installation
---------------

To use the library add these lines to your `CMakeLists.txt` file : 

```cmake

########################
## LIBRARY RETRIEVAL

# options that can be set ON or OFF
option(DEBUG_TFMPVALUE "If on, no optimisations and all warnings" OFF)
option(BUILD_TFMPVALUE_BINARIES "Build binaries on top of library (pv2sc,sc2pv,...)" OFF)
option(RUN_TFMPVALUE_TESTS "Run libtfmpvalue cmake tests" OFF)

# source retrival & static library build
FetchContent_Declare(
        libtfmpvalue
