# libtfmpvalue

A cmake overlay for TFMpvalue C++ library

This repo serves as a wrapper for the incredibly useful [TFM-Pvalue C++ program](http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/tfm-pvalue/tfm-pvalue.php). It allows users to determine score thresholds for a given transcription factor position frequency matrix associated with a specific p-value. Naturally, it can also perform the reverse, quickly calculating an accurate p-value from a score for a given motif matrix.

``libpytfmpval`` allows this functionality to be easily exploited via a cmake overlay.
This overlay does several things : 
  - core sources are built as a (static) library
  - package command-lines can be compiled via dedicated targets
  - tests from the original packages are implemented as cmake tests

Original sources can be found at http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/tfm-pvalue/tfm-pvalue.php.
